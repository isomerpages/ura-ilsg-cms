These are either made from seaweed bioplastics developed by the artists themselves, or upcycled from single-use plastics. The ‘reefs’ turn white temporarily when they sense movement and contact, alluding to coral bleaching caused by global warming and providing a stark reminder of how our actions can impact the environment. <br><br></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="Berenice Chao Zong Xin, Nicky Josephine Tjandra" src="/images/Installations/nicky_berry_profile_landscape_ilsg23%20-%20berenice%20chao-min.jpg"></div><p><strong>About the Artists</strong><br>Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, Berenice Chao and Nicky Tjandra create works focused on interactivity and multimedia.&nbsp; <br><br>Art and design is a universal language for Chao, who aspires to evoke a sense of amusement through her works.
