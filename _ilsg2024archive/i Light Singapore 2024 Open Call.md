### i Light Singapore 2024 Open Call 
<p style="font-size:17px; line-height:40px">
Asia’s leading sustainable light festival will return for its 10th edition to showcase new and exciting light art installations at Marina Bay.
<br><br>
For this edition, we invite artists to explore various forms of Sustainability and Sustainable Living - of environment, economy and culture - and examine how light art can create conversations about our lifestyles, decision making and the community.
<br><br>
The curatorial theme of i Light Singapore 2024, <b><i>Cyclical Nature</i></b>, calls for innovative light art installations that draw inspiration from the colour green - associated with nature as well as sustainable concepts such as the circular economy and upcycling.
<br><br>
<b><i>Cyclical Nature</i></b> reimagines the endless potential of everyday objects that are disposed of and their impact on nature through redesign, restoration, and repurposing.
