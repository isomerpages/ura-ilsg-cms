### i Light Singapore 2024 Student Call

<p style="font-size:17px; line-height:40px">
An open call for students from local tertiary institutions, the i Light Singapore Student Call enables creative youths to realise their potential through light art installations.
<br><br>
For this edition, the curatorial theme of i Light Singapore 2024, <b><i>Cyclical Nature</i></b>, calls for innovative light art installations that draw inspiration from the colour green - associated with nature as well as sustainable concepts such as the circular economy and upcycling.
<br><br>
<b><i>Cyclical Nature</i></b>   reimagines the endless potential of everyday objects that are disposed of and their impact on nature through redesign, restoration, and repurposing.
<br><br>
Be one of the light art installations to transform Marina Bay into magical landscape of light and colour at i Light Singapore 2024!
