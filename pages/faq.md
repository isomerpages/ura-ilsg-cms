<b>Q1. What is i Light Singapore all about?</b><br>
As the place manager of Marina Bay, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) of Singapore organises and facilitates exciting activities in the precinct in collaboration with other government agencies and private stakeholders. i Light Singapore, previously known as i Light Marina Bay, is one such event. Conceived in 2010 as one of several initiatives to inject vibrancy to Marina Bay, the light festival also promotes an important message of sustainability and advocates an environmentally-conscious way of life. The Festival has grown over the years to showcase not just light art installations, but also an array of complementary programmes. Returning this year, the Festival will run from 29 May – 21 June 2025.
