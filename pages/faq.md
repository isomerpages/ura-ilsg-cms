As the place manager of Marina Bay, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) of Singapore organises and facilitates exciting activities in the precinct in collaboration with other government agencies and private stakeholders. i Light Singapore, previously known as i Light Marina Bay, is one such event.
