<b>Q1. What is i Light Singapore all about?</b><br>
As the place manager of Marina Bay, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) of Singapore organises and facilitates exciting activities in the precinct in collaboration with other government agencies and private stakeholders. i Light Singapore, previously known as i Light Marina Bay, is one such event. Conceived in 2010 as one of several initiatives to inject vibrancy to Marina Bay, the sustainable light festival also promotes an important message of sustainability and advocates an environmentally-conscious way of life. The Festival has grown over the years to showcase not just sustainable light art installations, but also an array of complementary programmes. Returning for its 10th edition this year, the Festival will run over four weekends from 31 May – 23 June 2024.

<b>Q6. How is i Light Singapore a sustainable light festival?</b><br>
The light art installations at the festival are designed with energy-saving lightings, and recycled or environmentally-friendly materials. They serve as reminders to festival-goers to adopt sustainable habits in their everyday lives.
<br><br>
This year, the Festival is once again partnering&nbsp;susGain, a local social enterprise championing sustainability, on <b><i>i Light i Pledge, presented by Alibaba Cloud</i></b>. The public is encouraged to pledge their commitment to eco-conscious practices by making small but impactful changes in their daily lifestyle to cultivate sustainable habits.
<br><br>
They can do so through two separate pledges:
<br><br>
The <b><i>Switch Off Turn Up (SOTU)</i></b> pledge calls for all to switch off non-essential lightings and turn up air-conditioning temperatures during and beyond the festival period. Since the Festival’s inception in 2010, SOTU has been a key component of i Light Singapore's sustainability drive. The initiative has rallied many building owners, corporations and businesses around and beyond Marina Bay to reduce their energy consumption in lighting and air-conditioning. This year, more than 140 buildings and properties will be participating in the initiative (see list of participants <a href="/sustainability/switch-off-turn-up">here</a>). The programme has also been extended to the public and schools for the first time this year.
<br><br>
The <b><i>Be a Zero Hero</i></b> pledge encourages the public to adopt zero-waste habits such as reducing the use of single-use items and food waste. 
<br><br>For each pledge submitted by participants up to the first 5000 pledges, 100g of waste will be removed from Singapore waterways* by All Clear – a sustainability enterprise providing offshore and ocean clean-ups – will remove 100g of waste from Singapore waterways. As such, up to 500 kg of waste will be removed as an outcome of the pledge.
