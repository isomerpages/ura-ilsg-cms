<b>Q6. How is i Light Singapore a sustainable light festival?</b><br>
The light art installations at the festival are designed with energy-saving lightings, and recycled or environmentally-friendly materials. They serve as reminders to festival-goers to adopt sustainable habits in their everyday lives.
<br><br>
This year, the Festival is once again partnering&nbsp;susGain, a local social enterprise championing sustainability, on <b><i>i Light i Pledge, presented by Alibaba Cloud</i></b>. The public is encouraged to pledge their commitment to eco-conscious practices by making small but impactful changes in their daily lifestyle to cultivate sustainable habits.
<br><br>
They can do so through two separate pledges:
<br><br>
The <b><i>Switch Off Turn Up (SOTU)</i></b> pledge calls for all to switch off non-essential lightings and turn up air-conditioning temperatures during and beyond the festival period. Since the Festival’s inception in 2010, SOTU has been a key component of i Light Singapore's sustainability drive. The initiative has rallied many building owners, corporations and businesses around and beyond Marina Bay to reduce their energy consumption in lighting and air-conditioning. This year, close to 100 buildings and properties will be participating in the initiative (see list of participants <a target="_blank" href="/sustainability/switch-off-turn-up">here</a>). The programme has also been extended to the public and schools for the first time this year.
<br><br>
The <b><i>Be a Zero Hero</i></b> pledge encourages the public to adopt zero-waste habits such as reducing the use of single-use items and food waste. 
<br><br>For each pledge submitted by participants up to the first 5000 pledges, 100g of waste will be removed from Singapore waterways* by All Clear – a sustainability enterprise providing offshore and ocean clean-ups – will remove 100g of waste from Singapore waterways. As such, up to 500 kg of waste will be removed as an outcome of the pledge.
