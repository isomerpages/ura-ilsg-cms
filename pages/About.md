### **The Festival**
<p style="font-size:17px; line-height:40px">
i Light Singapore is Asiaâ€™s Leading Sustainable Light Festival held in Marina Bay.

First held in 2010, i Light Singapore showcases light art installations created by Singaporean and international artists. These artworks are designed with energy-saving lightings and/or environmentally-friendly materials to encourage festival goers and the general public to adopt sustainable habits in their everyday lives. The Festival also features a diverse range of fringe activities for visitors to enjoy, bringing vibrancy to public spaces in our city centre. </p>
