### i Light Singapore 2024 Call for Proposals - Festival Programmes
<p style="font-size:17px; line-height:40px">
Asia’s leading sustainable light festival will return for its 10th edition to showcase new and exciting light art installations at Marina Bay. 
<br><br>
Along with the curatorial theme of i Light Singapore 2024, <b><i>Cyclical Nature</i></b>, we invite all potential partners - Event Organisers/ Promoters, Entertainment Providers, F&B Operators, Non-Governmental Organisations with a focus on environmental sustainability, Performers and more – to submit innovative proposals on programmes that explore a new perspective on the connection between products and waste, as we shine a spotlight on waste materials in the approach, consciously extending their life cycle and unveiling their untapped potential.
<br><br>
Apart from its association with nature and sustainable concepts, <b><i>Cyclical Nature</i></b> strives towards closing material and energy loops, inspiring us to examine how can we create a cycle of rejuvenation that maintains the harmony of living with our natural and urban environments.
