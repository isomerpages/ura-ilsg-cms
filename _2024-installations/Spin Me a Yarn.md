<p><strong>Spin Me a Yarn</strong> 
<br>Studio Vertigo (United Kingdom)
<br><strong>Location: </strong>Mist Walk</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Spin Me a Yarn</em> features three oversized yarn balls, each with
its own long trail that loops over and around its surrounding environment.</p>
<p>With its larger-than-life design and conspicuous scale, the artwork is
an unusual addition to the surroundings that intentionally prompts a re-evaluation
of the commonplace. With yarn preparation being one of the contributors
to the fashion industryâ€™s global carbon emissions, <em>Spin Me a Yarn</em> examines
the unsustainable practices that underpin our modern lifestyles. It serves
as a reminder of the intricate threads that bind us all and the collective
responsibility that we bear in shaping the future.</p>
