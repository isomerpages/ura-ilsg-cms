<p><strong>Modern Guru and the Path to Artificial Happiness</strong> 
<br>ENESS (Australia)
<br><strong>Location: </strong>Millenia Walk (The Great Hall)</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Modern Guru and the Path to Artificial Happiness</em> juxtaposes the
timeless archetype of a guru, traditionally a guide to attain spiritual
enlightenment and happiness, with the contemporary pursuit of fulfilment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inside the ceremonial shroud, visitors are greeted by the Modern Guru,
a translucent ovoid with four imposing large digital eyes suspended above
a spiralling ring of LEDs. A stream of AI-generated absurdist messages
flows from its mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new message reveals itself when visitors point the lens of their camera
to capture a glimpse of the Modern Guru.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This installation is a commentary on the role that technology plays in
shaping perceptions of fulfilment in the digital age.&nbsp;</p>
