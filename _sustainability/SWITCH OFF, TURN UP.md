<p style="font-size:17px; line-height:40px">A key component of the Festival’s sustainability efforts since its inception in 2010, the <b><i>‘Switch Off, Turn Up’ (SOTU)</i></b> campaign rallies building owners, corporations and businesses around Marina Bay and beyond to reduce their energy consumption by switching off non-essential lightings and turning up their air conditioning temperatures. Stakeholders are encouraged to continue with these energy-saving habits beyond the Festival period.
<br><br>
For the first time this year, the initiative will expand beyond corporations to include schools and the general public.

Take part in <i>SOTU</i> through <i>i Light i Pledge, presented by Alibaba Cloud</i> at (hyperlink to microsite) today!
