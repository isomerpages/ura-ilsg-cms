<p>A key component of the Festivalâ€™s sustainability efforts since its inception
in 2010, the <em>Switch Off, Turn Up (SOTU)</em> campaign champions energy
conservation by encouraging building owners, corporations and businesses
to power off non-essential lighting and switch air conditioning to more
optimal temperatures throughout the festival duration. Participating organisations
are also encouraged to continue with these energy-saving habits beyond
the festival period.</p>
<p>A huge thank you to the following stakeholders for joining SOTU this year;
