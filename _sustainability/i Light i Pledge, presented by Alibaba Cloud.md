<p style="font-size:17px; line-height:40px">This year, the Festival is once again partnering susGain, a local social enterprise championing sustainability, on <i>i Light i Pledge</i>. The public is encouraged to pledge their commitment to eco-conscious practices by making small but impactful changes in their daily lifestyle to cultivate sustainable habits.
<br><br>
They can do so through two separate pledges:
<br><br>
The <b><i>Switch Off, Turn Up (SOTU)</i></b> pledge calls for all to switch off non-essential lightings and turn up air-conditioning temperatures during and beyond the festival period. Since the Festival’s inception in 2010, SOTU has been a key component of i Light Singapore’s sustainability drive. The initiative has rallied many building owners, corporations and businesses around and beyond Marina Bay to reduce their energy consumption in lighting and air-conditioning, and will continue to do so this year. Participation in the programme has been extended to the public and schools for the first time this year.
<br><br>
The <b><i>Be a Zero Hero</i></b> pledge encourages the public to adopt zero waste habits such as reducing the use of single-use items and food waste. For each pledge submitted by participants up to the first 5,000 pledges, All Clear – a sustainability enterprise providing offshore and ocean clean-ups – will remove 100g of waste from Singapore's waterways. As such, up to 500 kg of waste will be removed as an outcome of the pledge. 
<br><br>
	The public can take part in <i>i Light i Pledge</i> <a href="https://www.susgain.com/iLightiPledge">here</a> and stand to win attractive prizes.
<br><br>
For each pledge submitted online, a visual, unique to each pledge, will be generated using Alibaba Cloud’s AI technologies. The visuals can be viewed on <i>i Light i Pledge’s</i> website and as part of the last chapter at <i>Lightwave: Turning the Tide</i>. This initiative aims to demonstrate how a small step taken by an individual can contribute to a larger sustainability objective.</p>
