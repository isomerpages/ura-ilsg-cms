<h2>i Light Singapore 2025 Student Call</h2>
<p></p>
<p>An open call for students from local tertiary institutions, the i Light
Singapore Student Call enables creative youths to realise their potential
through light art installations.
<br>
<br>For this edition, the curatorial theme of i Light Singapore 2025, <strong><em>To Gather</em></strong>,
calls for innovative light art installations that draw inspiration from
the colour red - associated with elements that are essential for sustaining
life, red symbolises the primary energy source that radiates light and
warmth for life on Earth. As the lifeblood of our collective existence,
red is the common thread that binds us all together â€“ a call to embrace
unity in diversity.</p>
<p>
<br><strong><em>To Gather</em></strong> strives to spark conversations, foster
vibrant communities and inspire collective action so as to effect positive
change for a more sustainable future.
<br>
</p>
<p>Be one of the light art installations to transform Marina Bay into magical
landscape of light and colour at i Light Singapore 2024!</p>
