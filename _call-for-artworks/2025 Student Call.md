<h2>i Light Singapore 2025 Student Call</h2>
<p></p>
<p>An open call for students from local tertiary institutions, the i Light
Singapore Student Call enables creative youths to realise their potential
through light art installations.
<br>
<br>Asia’s leading sustainable light festival will return for its 11th edition
to showcase new and exciting light art installations at Marina Bay and
its neighbouring precincts.</p>
<p>For this edition, we invite artists to explore various forms of Sustainability
and Sustainable Living - of environment, economy and culture - and examine
how light art can create conversations about our lifestyles, decision making
and the community.</p>
<p>The curatorial theme of i Light Singapore 2025, <strong><em>To Gather</em></strong>,
calls for innovative light art installations that draw inspiration from
the colour red in moving the human collective. As the lifeblood of our
collective existence, red is the common thread that binds us all together
– a call to embrace unity in diversity.</p>
<p><strong><em>To Gather  </em></strong>strives to spark conversations, foster
vibrant communities and inspire collective action so as to effect positive
change for a more sustainable future.
<br>
<br>Be one of the light art installations to transform Marina Bay into magical
landscape of light and colour at i Light Singapore 2025!</p>
