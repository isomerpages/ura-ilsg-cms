<h2>i light Singapore 2025 Open Call</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Asia’s leading sustainable light festival will return for its 11th edition
to showcase new and exciting light art installations at Marina Bay and
its neighbouring precincts.
<br>
<br>For this edition, we invite artists to explore various forms of Sustainability
and Sustainable Living - of environment, economy and culture - and examine
how light art can create conversations about our lifestyles, decision making
and the community.
<br>
<br>The curatorial theme of i Light Singapore 2025, <strong><em>To Gather</em></strong>,
calls for innovative light art installations that draw inspiration from
the colour red - elements that are essential for sustaining life, red symbolises
the primary energy source that radiates light and warmth for life on Earth.
As the lifeblood of our collective existence, red is the common thread
that binds us all together – a call to embrace unity in diversity.
<br>
<br><strong><em>To Gather</em></strong> strives to spark conversations, foster
vibrant communities and inspire collective action so as to effect positive
change for a more sustainable future.
