<h2>i Light Singapore 2025 Open Call</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Asia’s leading sustainable light festival will return for its 11th edition
next year to showcase exciting light art installations at Marina Bay and
its neighbouring precincts.</p>
<p>Every edition, we invite artists to explore various forms of sustainability
and sustainable living - of environment, economy and culture - and examine
how light art can create conversations about our lifestyles, decision making
and the community.</p>
<p>The curatorial theme of i Light Singapore 2025, <strong><em>To Gather,</em></strong> calls
for innovative light art installations that draw inspiration from the colour
red in moving the human collective. As the lifeblood of our collective
existence, red is the common thread that binds us all together – a call
to embrace unity in diversity.</p>
<p><strong><em>To Gather </em></strong>strives to spark conversations, foster
vibrant communities and inspire collective action so as to effect positive
change for a more sustainable future.
