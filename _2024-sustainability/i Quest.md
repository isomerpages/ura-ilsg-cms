<p><strong>What is our collective impact?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>In partnership with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.seastainable.co/products/carbonethics-x-seastainable-help-restore-our-marine-ecosystems?variant=39367238418519" class="Hyperlink SCXW187520893 BCX8" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Seastainable</u></a></em>,
The Conscious Festival x i Light Singapore pledges to contribute to a restoration
programme located in Dompak Island, Bintan, which conducts research on
coastal preservation methods, trains and hires local communities to plant
mangrove and seaweed seedlings in their natural habitats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The restoration&nbsp;effort will be driven by&nbsp;festival&nbsp;visitors’&nbsp;participation&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>i Quest</strong>.&nbsp;Each
QR code scan contributes 1 point to the festival’s community scoreboard
in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon attaining 1,000&nbsp;points, we pledge to plant 160 mangrove and
seaweed seedlings. When this number grows to 3,000, we pledge to increase
our contribution to 400 seedlings to the restoration programme.&nbsp;</p>
