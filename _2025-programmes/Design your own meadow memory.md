<p><strong>Design your own meadow memory: Take home a piece of the festival with you</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Join us for a hands-on workshop where creativity meets sustainability.
Using offcuts from the meadow flowers from our installation, Take a walk
through the meadow with me, craft personalised charms for yourself and
your loved ones!</p>
<p>This workshop will explore how discarded materials have potential to be
transformed into beautiful, functional pieces through thoughtful design.</p>
<p>Each participant will create a unique accessory whilst reflecting on the
value of sustainability and creative reuse.</p>
<p>Take home not just a handmade charm, but a meaningful reminder of the
installation's message — that with a little imagination, everyday waste
can be turned into something truly special. This also echoes Singapore's
ongoing journey as a “Nation by Design”, where thoughtful design can help
us shape meaningful experiences and solutions for a more sustainable future.&nbsp;</p>
