that transforms the Festival Village into a vibrant stage for change. Jelilo
characters — Captain Skull, One Eye, and Scarface — take centre stage and
rally festivalgoers to take collective action against marine pollution
and encourage environmental sustainability. Using energy-efficient lights,
the installations embody i Light Singapore's curatorial theme "To Gather"
whilst serving as both a visual spectacle and an educational platform.
