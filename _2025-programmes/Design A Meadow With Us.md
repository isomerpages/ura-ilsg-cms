<p><strong>Design a Meadow with Us: Take home a piece of the festival with you </strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Join us for a hands-on workshop where creativity meets sustainability.
Upcycle the remnants of meadow flowers from our installation, Take a walk
through the meadow with me, and craft personalised charms for yourself
and your loved ones!</p>
<p>This workshop showcases how discarded materials can be transformed into
beautiful, functional art through thoughtful design.</p>
<p>Each participant will create a unique accessory whilst reflecting on the
value of sustainability and creative reuse.</p>
<p>Take home a meaningful reminder of the installation's message â€” that with
a little imagination, everyday waste can be turned into something truly
special.</p>
<p>Be part of the ongoing conversation about sustainability through art and
community participation, and bring a piece of the festival with you.</p>
