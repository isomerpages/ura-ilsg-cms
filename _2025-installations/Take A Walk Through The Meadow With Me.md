<br>
<br>Inspired by the breezy dance of dandelion petals — an embodiment of free-spiritedness
and playfulness — <em>Dandelion</em> whisks visitors into a realm of hope
and optimism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make a wish as it bursts into a symphony of light and music every five
minutes. The score is an original musical piece by Otis Studio, and is
an ode to the wind as well as the intrinsic characteristics of the dandelion,
revered for healing properties in certain cultures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Dandelion</em> is a sanctuary for all, offering visitors a moment to
pause from the frenetic pace of life and reconnect with the marvels of
nature.&nbsp;</p>
