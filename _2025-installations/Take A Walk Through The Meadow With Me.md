<p><strong>Take A Walk Through The Meadow With Me</strong>

<br><strong>Location:</strong> Lawn beside NTUC Building
<br><em>Presented by DesignSingapore Council</em>
<br>Supported by: National University of Singapore - E-Waste Donation for
i Light Singapore 2025 Art Installation
<br>
<br>Take a walk through the meadow with me is an immersive, interactive installation
that responds to movement and human presence. As you get close to the artwork,
flowers begin to glow and music follows. As more people gather, more lights
appear, and melodic notes play in tandem — the sensory experience intensifies
as the crowd grows.</p>
<p>Once-discarded acrylic waste has now been shaped into flowers, and industrial
fragments have found renewed purpose in this garden, creating a backdrop
where collective memories take shape.</p>
<p>This installation invites visitors to reflect on the hidden beauty in
discarded items and explore how human presence can co-create a landscape
of renewal, connection and transformation.</p>
