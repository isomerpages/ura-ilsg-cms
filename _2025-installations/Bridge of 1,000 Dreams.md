<p><strong>Bridge of 1,000 Dreams</strong>
<br>Studio Toer (The Netherlands)
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Cavenagh Bridge
<br>
<br>A thousand bamboo sticks shape a corridor of dreams shining bright, featuring
Singapore motifs created by local design studio Binary Style. Each one
carries the mark of a different hand, a different mind. A thousand futures,
translated into designs by those who will live them.</p>
<p>As UOB commemorates 90 years of service to the community, this glowing
structure bears the aspirations of children in our society. The drawings
speak of UOB’s enduring focus – to support the dreams of its community
by building a stronger tomorrow for all.</p>
<p>This bridge also reflects a country designed through collective imagination,
ambition and determination. As a “Nation by Design”, a theme celebrated
by DesignSingapore Council for SG60, Singapore has transformed into a liveable
and loveable city – not by chance, but through deliberate and intentional
design. <em>Bridge of 1,000 Dreams</em> reminds us that design has always
been at the heart of our nation’s development.</p>
<p>From a distance, personal expressions blur into unified light. One sees
not the individual sticks but the entire bridge — a metaphor for how society
functions when personal aspirations become public possibilities.</p>
<p>Whose dreams will shape tomorrow? Here, the answer is everyone’s.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Extended viewing till 20 July 2025.</p>
