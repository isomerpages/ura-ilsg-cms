<p><strong>Reverse Waterfall</strong>
<br>Studio UxU (Taiwan)
<br><strong>Location:</strong> UOB Plaza Façade
<br><em>Presented by United Overseas Bank</em>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Waterfalls have captivated humanity for centuries, and we continue to
recognise them as attractions today. In Reverse Waterfall, hundreds of
LED meteor tubes are hand-arranged in vertical patterns to create the semblance
of falling water. As you approach this digital cascade, the unexpected
unfolds — lights flow upward, defying gravity, and time itself becomes
an enigma, deliberately confounding expectations. The artwork evokes familiarity,
only to disrupt it through change and fragmentation.</p>
<p>Reverse Waterfall challenges us to question what appears as self-evident
— and what we take for granted as “natural”. It invites reflection on how
our beliefs shape our understanding of the world and how those beliefs
evolve when we take the chance to look at them more closely. The artwork
explores the space between what we think we know and what we eventually
come to understand, urging a deeper look at our preconceived perceptions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About the Artists</strong>
</p>
<p>UxU Studio, founded in Taiwan by Kuan-Hung Chen and Ying-Chu Chen, creates
multidisciplinary work spanning object design to monumental installations,
with a focus on bridging architecture, design and art through innovative
space creation.</p>
<p>Their exhibition journey began in Taiwan with the Yuejin and Taiwan Lantern
Festivals. International recognition followed in 2018 at Amsterdam Light
Festival — a first for Taiwanese artists. Their light installations have
since illuminated festivals across Europe (the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,
Sweden), Asia (Japan, South Korea), and the Middle East (Saudi Arabia,
United Arab Emirates), reflecting their ambition to showcase Taiwan's creative
energy globally.</p>
