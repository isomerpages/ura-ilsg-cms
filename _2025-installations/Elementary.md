<p><strong>Elementary</strong>
<br>Tonoptik (Montenegro)
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Clifford Square <em>&nbsp;</em>
<br>
<br><em>Elementary </em>transforms a flat screen into an illusion composed
of light, depth, physics and control. It brings deep waters and abstract
worlds into our urban environment. Within the cube’s virtual space, these
otherworldly interactive shapes float in response to viewers' movements.
Viewers on both sides attempt to take control of the shapes, only to find
unpredictability.</p>
<p><em>Elementary </em>shows how minute actions can lead to big changes.
Just like nature itself, the installation follows its own rules and unusual
laws of physics, responding to human presence yet without being controlled
by it.</p>
<p>The artwork is a reminder that nature's elements and forces follow beautiful
and mysterious patterns. We can learn and engage with them — but their
essence remains their own.&nbsp;</p>
