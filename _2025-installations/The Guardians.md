<p><strong>The Guardians</strong>
<br>The Beautiful and Useful Studio (Australia)
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Raffles Place Park
<br><em>Presented by Raffles Place Alliance</em>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The Guardians is an immersive landscape of inflatables. Recycled materials
are transformed into abstract tropical flowers and foliage. The work is
created in a studio that operates solely on solar power, and the sculptures
will return to other uses when the exhibition ends. This temporality mirrors
the flowers they represent — here for a season, then gone, but never truly
lost.</p>
<p>A family history of florists spans three generations before this artist.
Aberline’s grandmother, mother and sister all arranged actual blooms. Here,
identity, family and kinship are explored through abstracted forms.</p>
<p>These silent guardians create a space for gathering, where for a shared
moment, no one remains a stranger to beauty.&nbsp;</p>
