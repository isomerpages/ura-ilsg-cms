<p><strong>The Guardians</strong>
<br>Matthew Aberline &amp; The Beautiful and Useful Studio (Australia)
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Raffles Place Park &nbsp;
<br>
<br><em>The Guardians</em> is an immersive landscape of vibrant inflatable
sculptures. Recycled materials are transformed into abstract representations
of tropical flowers and foliage in a studio that operates solely on solar
power. Six of the inflatables are localised, drawing inspiration from Singapore's
flora and fauna.</p>
<p>With a family history of florists spanning three generations, the artistâ€™s
grandmother, mother and sister all arranged real-life blooms. In this work,
the artist explores enduring connections between landscape, identity and
kinship through vibrant artistic forms.</p>
<p>These silent guardians create a space for gathering where, for a shared
moment, no one remains a stranger to beauty.&nbsp;</p>
