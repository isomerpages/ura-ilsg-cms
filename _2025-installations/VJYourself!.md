<p><strong>VJYourself!</strong>
<br>Playmodes Studio (Spain)
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Entrance of Marina Bay Link Mall
<br>
<br><em>VJYourself!</em> is a magic mirror for the twenty-first century. It
captures not just visitors’ reflections, but also time itself. <em>VJYourself!</em> returns
digital echoes of its participants dancing by repeating and composing their
movements into a new choreography. It multiplies play and time into a joyful
chaos, which grows as more participants get involved — users can dance
together to create a montage.</p>
<p>As the self meets its past and present across these moments, <em>VJYourself!</em> celebrates
how our actions can create unexpected beauty when digitally captured and
layered, almost like scrolling through forgotten happy memories on social
media. It invites us to get lost in the moment and surrender to the pure
delight of being transformed through time and technology.</p>

<p><strong>About the artist</strong>
</p>
<p>Playmodes comprises a creative duo.</p>
<p>Santi Vilanova and Eloi Maduell merge the fields of graphic design, musical
composition and computer engineering to conceive works that marry art with
science and audiovisual research in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Developed using home-made technologies, their work often takes the form
of immersive light installations, graphic works, sculptural devices, kinetic
engines, scenography or even multimedia concerts that explore an abstract
universe of visual music.</p>
