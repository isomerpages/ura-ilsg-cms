<p><strong>Urban Oracle</strong>
<br>Ultravioletto (Italy)
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Pontoon near Red Dot Design Museum
<br>
<br>Twenty-four illuminated letters are suspended along the pontoon’s edge,
their light reflected in the water below.</p>
<p>Red buttons stand at three points along the boardwalk. When pressed, light
pulses through the letters steadily like a heartbeat, triggering thought-provoking
AI-generated messages inspired by Singapore’s past, present and future.</p>
<p><em>Urban Oracle</em> is Ultravioletto's reimagining of divination. Where
ancient pilgrims once sought wisdom from temple oracles, modern society
now turns to digital systems and algorithms for guidance. Visitors can
consult <em>Urban Oracle</em> in a similar fashion, as it merges cultural
heritage with environmental imperatives in its answers, drawing on ancient
knowledge while gently guiding us towards a more sustainable future.</p>
