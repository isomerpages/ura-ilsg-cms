<p><strong>Urban Oracle</strong>
<br>Ultravioletto (Italy)
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Pontoon near Red Dot Design Museum
<br><em>Presented by Alibaba Cloud</em> 
<br>
<br>Twenty-four illuminated letters are suspended along the pontoon’s edge,
their light reflected in the water below.</p>
<p>Red buttons stand at three points along the boardwalk. When pressed, light
pulses through the letters steadily like a heartbeat, triggering thought-provoking
AI-generated messages inspired by Singapore’s past, present and future.</p>
<p>Urban Oracle is Ultravioletto's reimagining of divination. Where ancient
pilgrims once sought wisdom from temple oracles, modern society now turns
to digital systems and algorithms for guidance. Visitors can consult Urban
Oracle in a similar fashion, as it merges cultural heritage with environmental
imperatives in its answers, drawing on ancient knowledge while gently guiding
us toward a more sustainable future.</p>
