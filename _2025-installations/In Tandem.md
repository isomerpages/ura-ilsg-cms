<p><strong>In Tandem</strong>
<br>Lee Si Heidi, Rae Koh and Leela Rao (Singapore)
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Breeze Shelters &nbsp;
<br>
<br><em>In Tandem</em> explores harmony and human connection through the rhythm
of our heartbeats.
<br>
<br>When its sensors are touched by two or more visitors, it seamlessly synchronises
their interactions, creating a unified light show that pulses in tandem.
<br>
<br><em>In Tandem</em> illustrates the scientific concept of cardiac physiological
synchrony, when heart rate activity finds shared rhythm between interacting
individuals who share a meaningful connection, such that proximity creates
harmony. It reveals how humans tune in to one another unconsciously and
how separate lives can, however briefly, share a common pulse.</p>
