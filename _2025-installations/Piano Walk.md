<p><strong>Piano Walk</strong>
<br>Amigo &amp; Amigo (Australia)
<br>Commissioned musical score by Otis Studio
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Marina Bay Sands Event Plaza
<br><em>Presented by Marina Bay Sands</em>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>With this larger-than-life piano, strangers become collaborators. What
was once confined to a soloist is now spread among many hands and feet,
gliding across an expanded landscape of sound.</p>
<p>Magnifying the carefully crafted elements that are typically hidden within
a conventional piano — felt hammers, brass strings, wooden soundboards
— <em>Piano Walk</em> plays an original composition by John McHugh (Otis
Studio) every five minutes, following visitors’ interaction with it. It
then returns to silence, awaiting new visitors to step, walk or hop into
the space to continue the melody.</p>
<p>Crafted from durable materials, its robust design enables visitors, separated
by geography, to connect over time and space through the shared experience
of touching the same keys. In this way, <em>Piano Walk</em> creates space
to gather for shared communal experiences around the world.</p>
