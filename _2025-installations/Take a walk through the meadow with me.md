<p><strong>Take a walk through the meadow with me</strong>
<br>Megan Tan and Tan Shao Xuan (Singapore) &nbsp;
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Lawn beside NTUC Building
<br>
<br><em>Take a walk through the meadow</em> with me is an immersive, interactive
installation that responds to movement and human presence. As you get close
to the artwork, flowers begin to glow and music follows. As more people
gather, more lights appear, and melodic notes play in tandem — the sensory
experience intensifies as the crowd grows.</p>
<p>Once-discarded acrylic waste has now been shaped into flowers, and industrial
fragments have found renewed purpose in this garden, creating a backdrop
where collective memories take shape.</p>
<p>This installation invites visitors to reflect on the hidden beauty in
discarded items, and explore how human presence can co-create a landscape
of renewal, connection and transformation.</p>
<p>It also resonates with Singapore’s ongoing journey as a “Nation by Design”,
where thoughtful design can help us shape meaningful experiences and solutions
for a more sustainable future. “Nation by Design” is part of DesignSingapore
Council’s initiatives for SG60 and celebrates Singapore’s transformation
into a liveable and loveable city by design..</p>
