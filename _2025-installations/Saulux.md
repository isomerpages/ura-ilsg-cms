<br>SPLACES.STUDIO (Malta) &nbsp;
<br><strong>Location:</strong> South Beach Towers – Fountain Plaza
<br><em>Presented by South Beach</em>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Saulux reveals the invisible currents that surround us daily. Wind moves
through a dense field of willow twigs. The stems respond with light — a
warm glow at 2200K, the exact colour temperature of afternoon sun. The
name itself tells this story: saule (willow) meets lux (light).</p>
<p>At the centre of this artificial grove sits a weatherproof case housing
a microcomputer. Sensors detect the movement of each twig. A neural network
processes these signals into patterns of light and sound. Like the natural
world itself, no two moments produce identical configurations.</p>
<p>Saulux does not represent nature but responds to it. It is an invitation
for all to pause and connect with nature in a profoundly new and beautiful
way.&nbsp;</p>
