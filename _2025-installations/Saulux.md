<p><strong>Saulux</strong>
<br>SPLACES.STUDIO (Malta) &nbsp;
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Fountain Plaza, South Beach Avenue Level 1
<br><em>Presented by South Beach Consortium&nbsp; </em>
<br>
<br><em>Saulux </em>reveals the invisible currents that surround us daily.
As wind moves through this dense field of willow twigs, the stems respond
with light â€” a warm glow at 2200K, the corresponding colour temperature
of warm, natural sunlight. The name itself tells this story: <em>saule </em>(willow)
meets <em>lux </em>(light).</p>
<p>At the centre of this artificial grove sits a weatherproof case housing
a microcomputer. Sensors detect the movement of each twig in the breeze,
and a neural network processes these signals into patterns of light and
sound. Like the natural world itself, no two moments produce identical
configurations.</p>
<p><em>Saulux </em>both represents nature and responds to it, highlighting
the magic found in the everyday. It is an invitation for all to pause and
connect with nature in a profoundly new and beautiful way.&nbsp;</p>
