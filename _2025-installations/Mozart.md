<p><strong>Mozart</strong>
<br>StudioGEAR (China)
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Steps at the Helix Bridge &nbsp;
<br>
<br>A deconstructed grand piano has been reassembled into an abstract white
sphere suspended above an open staircase. Each step on the staircase now
functions as a piano key, producing light and sound when activated by footsteps.</p>
<p><em>Mozart</em> acknowledges both the eponymous composer’s bold visions
and innovative spirit by breaking apart the familiar and freeing it from
convention. The artwork celebrates how disruption can generate creativity.</p>
<p>The sphere’s form suggests completeness while the deconstructed elements
reveal a functional disorder. As our movements trigger sounds and illumination,
we are invited to compose something new collectively.</p>
<p>We often resist disruption, yet it remains an essential part of life and
progress. <em>Mozart </em>reminds us that, when things fall apart unexpectedly,
we can step up, take action and work towards new beginnings.</p>
<p>The soundscape reinterprets Mozart's compositions and is created specifically
for this installation..</p>
