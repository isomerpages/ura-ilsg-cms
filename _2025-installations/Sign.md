<p><strong>Sign</strong>
<br>Vendel &amp; de Wolf (The Netherlands)
<br><strong>Location:</strong> The Promontory &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Fire commands attention. It can be a signal for help or to highlight danger
— its meaning shifts in each context. Yet, no one misses it; fire captivates
and fascinates us.</p>
<p>Fire also symbolises radical change, the moment when everything shifts.
We witness the transformative power of fire daily — melting sand into glass,
and rejuvenating landscapes by clearing the old to make way for new growth.</p>
<p><em>Sign</em> is a grand display of flames dancing in the air, beckoning
us to gather around it. Stepping closer to the ‘fire’ reveals that these
are bamboo poles covered with reflective aluminium tape, catching light
to create an optical illusion. This image challenges perceptions, inviting
us to reflect on how destruction can be creative, and how endings can also
pave the way for new beginnings.</p>

<p><strong>About the artist</strong>
</p>
<p>Artists Paul Vendel (1964) and Sandra de Wolf (1966) met during their
studies at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy and have been working together ever
since. Their works, mostly installations, are often located in public spaces
and usually custom-made for those locations. The artists favour the use
of recognisable and existing objects or materials. Rather than creating
pieces that overtly declare themselves as art, Vendel &amp; de Wolf strive
to create works that are accessible to everyone.</p>
