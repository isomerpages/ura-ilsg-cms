<p><strong>Bridge Of 1000 Dreams</strong>
<br>Studio Toer (The Netherlands)
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Cavenagh Bridge
<br><em>Presented by DesignSingapore Council and United Overseas Bank</em>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Bamboo sticks form a pathway of light. Each one carries the mark of a
different hand, a different mind. One thousand futures, proposed by those
who will live them.
<br>
<br>This bridge reflects a country designed through collective imagination.
A liveable city shaped not by chance but by intention. As Singapore celebrates
SG60, <em>Bridge of 1000 Dreams</em> reveals how design has always been at
the heart of the transformation.</p>
<p>From a distance, personal expressions blur into unified light. One sees
not the individual stick but the bridge itself&nbsp; — a metaphor for how
society functions when private aspirations become public possibilities.</p>
<p>As UOB commemorates 90 years of service to communities, this glowing structure
bears the dreams of its beneficiaries, children, and employees. The drawings
speak of its enduring focus — to support the dreams of its community by
building a stronger tomorrow for all.
<br>
<br>Whose dreams will shape tomorrow? Here, the answer is everyone's.&nbsp;</p>
