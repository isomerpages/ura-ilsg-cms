<p><strong>This Is Not A Screen</strong>
<br>National University of Singapore (Singapore)
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Courtyard between South Beach Tower and The
Grand Ballroom, Level 1
<br><em>Presented by Aedas</em>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Screens permeate modern existence, from small screens in pockets and medium
screens on desks to large screens on walls. Each presents a curated version
of the world, filtered through invisible algorithms.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>This Is Not A Screen</em> examines this phenomenon using polarised
screens that alter light. Depending on the viewing angle, no two visitors
see the same image. Visitors can create new visual perspectives by rotating
the screens, which distort light to create unique perceptions of the monolith
in the middle, much like how digital interfaces customise reality for their
users.</p>
<p>This installation prompts reflection about collective experiences. When
individuals receive personalised versions of information, the nature of
common experience and discourse shifts. Our screens simultaneously create
both a shared platform and individual realities.</p>
<p>Offering no easy judgement about digital life, <em>This Is Not A Screen</em> simply
makes visible the usually invisible process of filtering. It reveals how
screens transform not only <em>what</em> we see but also <em>how</em> we see.&nbsp;</p>

Nyunt Aung are a group of Master of Architecture students from the National
University of Singapore.</p>

transformative. Their artistic mission: to reveal what is typically unseen
through design, and to challenge perceptions and prompt alternative perspectives
through reflection, conversation and reinterpretation.&nbsp;</p>
