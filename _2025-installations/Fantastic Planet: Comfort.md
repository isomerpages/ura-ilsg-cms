<p><strong>Fantastic Planet: Comfort</strong>
<br>Amanda Parer (Australia)
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Waterfront Promenade &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Three glowing humanoid figures, in different poses, have taken over this
corner of the waterfront promenade. These illuminated beings have silently
landed and begun gently exploring our <em>Fantastic Planet</em>.</p>
<p>They are curiously, quietly watching us roam. Their immense size flips
our sense of scale, rendering us small — no longer the observers, but the
observed.</p>
<p>Inspired by René Laloux's 1973 film <em>La Planète Sauvage</em>, where
enormous beings dominate a world with feral humans, these giant figures
in <em>Fantastic Planet</em> echo David Attenborough's warnings about humanity’s
overwhelming impact on Earth: we are a species demanding more than its
share.</p>

<p><strong>About the artist</strong>
</p>
<p>Amanda Parer explores mankind's complex relationship with nature. Her
Tasmanian homeland provides dramatic landscapes that inspire her work.
Following a transformative trip to the Galapagos Islands in 1995, while
assisting on award-winning nature documentaries, she has focused on environmental
themes in her work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parer's oversized installations blend humour with gravity, using scale,
light and darkness to make ecological topics accessible and approachable.
This is an entry point to her deeper concern - environmental mismanagement
by humans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her work has achieved global recognition, having been featured in international
exhibitions and on platforms reaching millions of viewers.</p>
