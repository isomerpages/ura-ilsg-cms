<p><strong>Embrace</strong>
<br>Beamhacker (Australia)
<br>Commissioned musical score by Peter McAvan
<br><strong>Location:</strong> Event Square</p>
<p><em>Presented by Defence Collective Singapore</em>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Inspired by children’s paper chains, <em>Embrace</em> features a circle
of life-sized silhouettes that come alive through human touch. Stand among
the figures, grasp their hands, and watch as ripples of light dance through
the ring. When all the figures are connected, the installation transforms
into a symphony of light and sound.</p>
<p>Inviting a return to childhood, the paper doll reference evokes memories
of gliding scissors through folded paper, which then unfolds to uncover
a series of joined hands. <em>Embrace</em> brings to mind this forgotten
joy through a moment of shared magic.</p>
<p>Created exclusively for i Light Singapore 2025, the silhouettes display
camouflaged patterns, representing the four services of the Singapore Armed
Forces. Everyone – both military and civilian – is invited to join their
hands to complete the circle. This image of the protector and protected
standing hand-in-hand expresses how our military’s strength is amplified
through the unwavering support of our people. <em>Embrace</em> is set against
the backdrop of Marina Bay, encouraging reflection and participation in
a place of national pride.</p>
