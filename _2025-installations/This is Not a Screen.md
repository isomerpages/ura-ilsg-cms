<p><strong>This is Not a Screen</strong>
<br>National University of Singapore (Singapore)
<br><strong>Location:</strong> South Beach Avenue, Level B1 &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Screens permeate modern existence, from small screens in pockets and medium
screens on desks to large screens on walls. Each presents a curated version
of the world, filtered through invisible algorithms.</p>
<p><em>This is Not a Screen</em> examines this phenomenon using polarised
screens recycled from our devices, altering light in fascinating ways.
Depending on the viewing angle, no two visitors see the same image. You
can create new visual perspectives by rotating the screens, which distort
light to create unique perceptions of the monolith in the centre, much
like how digital interfaces customise reality for their users.</p>
<p>This installation prompts reflection about collective experiences. When
individuals receive personalised versions of information, the nature of
common experience and discourse shifts. Our screens simultaneously create
both a shared platform and individual realities.</p>
<p>Offering no easy judgement about digital life, <em>This is Not a Screen</em> simply
makes visible the usually invisible process of filtering. It reveals how
screens transform not only what we see but also <em>how </em>we see.</p>

Nyunt Aung are a group of Master of Architecture students from the National
University of Singapore.</p>

and personally transformative. Their artistic mission: to reveal what is
typically unseen through design, and to challenge perceptions and prompt
alternative perspectives through reflection, conversation and reinterpretation.</p>
