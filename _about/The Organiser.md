<h3>Urban Redevelopment Authority</h3>
<p>The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is Singapore's land use planning
and conservation agency. Our mission is "to make Singapore a great city
to live, work and play". We strive to create an endearing home and a vibrant
city through long-term planning and innovation, in partnership with the
community.</p>
<p>URAâ€™s multi-faceted role includes being the main government land sales
agent. We attract and channel private capital investments to develop sites
that support planning, economic and social objectives. We also partner
the community to enliven our public spaces to create a car-lite, people-friendly
and liveable city for all to enjoy. In shaping a distinctive city, URA
also promotes architecture and urban design excellence.</p>
