<h3>Urban Redevelopment Authority </h3><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/en?_p_lc=4"><img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2025 ilsg sponsor logos/Alibaba_Cloud_urban_oracle.png"></a>
<p>The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is Singapore’s land use planning
and conservation agency. Our mission is “to make Singapore a great city
to live, work and play”. We strive to create an endearing home and a vibrant
city through long-term planning and innovation, in partnership with the
community.</p>
<p>We have transformed Singapore into one of the most liveable cities in
Asia through judicious land use planning and good urban design. Adopting
a long-term and comprehensive planning approach, we formulate strategic
plans such as the Long-Term Plan and the Master Plan to guide the physical
development of Singapore in a sustainable manner. Developed to support
economic growth, our plans and policies are focused on achieving a quality
living environment for Singapore.</p>
<p>We take on a multi-faceted role to turn plans and visions into reality.
As the main government land sales agent, we attract and channel private
capital investments to develop sites that support planning, economic and
social objectives. Through our regulatory function, we ensure that development
works are aligned with our plans. As the conservation authority, we have
an internationally recognised conservation programme, and have successfully
conserved not just single buildings, but entire districts. We also partner
the community to enliven our public spaces to create a car-lite, people-friendly
and liveable city for all to enjoy.</p>
<p>In shaping a distinctive city, we promote architecture and urban design
excellence, and innovate to build a resilient city of opportunity that
fulfils the aspirations of our people.</p>
