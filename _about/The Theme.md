<p><strong>To Gather</strong> - the curatorial theme of i Light Singapore
2025 - draws inspiration from the colour red from the Visible Light narrative.
<br>
</p>
<p>Red has the power to move the human collective. It evokes in us the emotions
of love and passion. It brings communities together for celebrations in
some cultures. Red can also symbolise power. It seizes our attention to
what is important or urgent. Red has the ability to influence our behaviour
in profound ways and ignites movement for change.
<br>
</p>
<p>Often associated with elements that are essential for sustaining life,
red symbolises the primary energy source that radiates light and warmth
for life on Earth. As the lifeblood of our collective existence, red is
the common thread that binds us all together - a call to embrace unity
in diversity.
<br>
</p>
<p>To Gather strives to spark conversations, foster vibrant communities and
inspire collective action so as to effect positive change for a more sustainable
future.
<br>
<br>Let's come together and paint the town red!</p>
