<h3>Cyclical Nature </h3>
<p>Light is a wave, radiating in all directions. It transmits diverse energy
and momentum which in turn, determines how we see space. Yet, light is
also a language – a system of communication, resulting in a spectrum of
emotions and habitual associations. This spectrum of colours in visible
light is superimposed over five editions of i Light Singapore, each featuring
a different hue since 2022. The festival serves as a medium which refracts
the diversity of the light spectrum, dispersing it into colours of creativity.​</p>
<p><strong><em>Cyclical Nature</em></strong> – the curatorial theme of i Light
Singapore 2024 – draws inspiration from the colour green from i Light Singapore’s
Visible Light narrative. With green often associated with nature as well
as sustainable concepts such as the circular economy and upcycling, <strong><em>Cyclical Nature</em></strong> explores
and reimagines the endless potential of everyday objects that are disposed
of and their impact on nature through redesign, restoration and repurposing.​</p>
<p>We invite artists to rethink the relationship between products and waste
from a fresh perspective as we place waste materials centre stage in the
creative process, conscientiously extending their lifespan, and showcasing
their hidden potential.​</p>
<p>As we strive towards closing material and energy loops, let us examine
how can we create a cycle of rejuvenation that maintains the harmony of
living with our natural and urban environments.​</p>
