<p>Anchored on the theme <em>To Gather</em> and the colour red – a wavelength
on the visible light spectrum symbolising our collective existence – the
Festival will feature installations and programmes designed to spark community
dialogue about creating a more sustainable future. 17 light art installations
from 20 local and international artists will contribute to a line-up that
celebrates diversity, unity, connection and belonging.</p>
