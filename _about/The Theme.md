### A New Wave

<p style="font-size:17px; line-height:40px">Light is a wave, which expands and radiates in all directions. It transmits diverse energy and momentum which in turn,&nbsp;determines how we see space. Yet, light is also a language – a system of communication, resulting in a spectrum of&nbsp;emotions and habitual associations. This spectrum of&nbsp;colours&nbsp;in visible light is superimposed over&nbsp;five editions of&nbsp;i&nbsp;Light&nbsp;Singapore, with a different segment of hues for each year. The Festival becomes a medium which refracts the diversity of&nbsp;the light spectrum, dispersing it into colours of creativity.
<br><br>
As the second year of i Light Singapore’s&nbsp;Visible Light&nbsp;narrative, the 2023 edition will explore the&nbsp;colour&nbsp;blue of the light&nbsp;spectrum. Blue wavelengths are ever-present in nature, as of the unclouded skies and in the reflections of the waters&nbsp;(the seas). Visually, the cool tones of blue can&nbsp;symbolise&nbsp;and induce varying states of emotion – often associated with&nbsp;calmness and serenity. Reflecting on our renewed condition, how do we relate blue to a new era of healing and&nbsp;advancement?
<br><br>
Our cognition allows us to acquire knowledge and perspectives through thought, senses and perception. In&nbsp;colour&nbsp;psychology, blue encourages introspection, which solidifies our understanding of ourselves in the world. Blue also&nbsp;represents intelligence, where interpretations and conclusions can be derived through observation and exploration of&nbsp;data and phenomena around us. Blue is also inextricably linked to technology, where innovation&nbsp;opens up&nbsp;new&nbsp;paradigms of experience and wonder.
<br><br>
As Asia’s leading sustainable light festival, i Light Singapore illuminates Marina Bay with a constellation of light artworks&nbsp;to transmit waves of excitement and interactions. The curatorial theme of i Light Singapore 2023 presented by DBS,&nbsp;<b><i>A New Wave</i></b>, calls for&nbsp;innovative light art installations that encompass associations with the&nbsp;colour&nbsp;blue - the limitless potential of technology&nbsp;to create novel experiences beyond the physical, and the synergy between nature and technology. How can technology&nbsp;manifest in our natural environment? Has technological intelligence improved our lives?&nbsp;<b><i>A New Wave</i></b>&nbsp;encourages&nbsp;creative methods and ideas that reflect the energy of blue to inspire connections in the city, refresh people’s senses and&nbsp;immerse visitors in new realms.</p>
