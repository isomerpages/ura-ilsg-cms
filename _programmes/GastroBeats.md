<p><em>GastroBeats</em> is the Festival Village of i Light Singapore 2024
that will feature a wide range of gastronomic delights and musical experiences.
Visitors will be spoilt for choice with the inclusion of more sustainably-produced
food options, including items cultivated through organic farming methods,
locally-grown seasonal produce and ethically sourced meat. An enticing
array of local and international cuisine ranging from Mexican tacos, Russian
dumplings and prawn noodles awaits.
<br>
<br>This year, <em>GastroBeats</em> will strengthen its sustainability efforts
by tapping on solar energy to optimise rechargeable batteries for its light
posts, wayfinding signage and powering back-of-house operations. Solar
energy will also be used to power air-conditioned “portaloos”, setting
a new benchmark for eco-conscious event amenities. To encourage visitors
to put into practice green habits, <em>GastroBeats</em> strongly encourages
visitors to bring their own cup/flask/tupperware to reduce waste. Eco-friendly
food packaging and utensils will be used and no plastic straws will be
provided.
