<p><strong>GastroBeats - Festival Village of i Light Singapore: A feast of flavours and a symphony of sounds.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Embark on a culinary adventure with a tantalising selection of mouth-watering
treats from around the world. From street food to gourmet delights, there's
something to satisfy every craving! Visitors will be spoilt for choice
with the inclusion of more sustainably-produced food options, including
ingredients cultivated through organic farming methods, locally-grown seasonal
produce and ethically sourced meats. An enticing array of local and international
cuisines ranging from Mexican tacos to Russian dumplings and prawn noodles
awaits.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Experience the electrifying energy of daily live music performances featuring
local talents mentored by GastroBeats’ Chief Music Officer Sara Wee and
well-loved local band 53A through the GIG-ers campaign, alongside other
musical artists.&nbsp; They’re sure to have you dancing all night long!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Festival Village is also proud to introduce a star-studded team of
GB-LETs- GastroBeats ambassadors embodying the GastroBeats brand and values
who are personally handpicked and mentored by the Chief Content Officers
of GastroBeats, Aiken Chia and Nina Tan.</p>
<p>This year, GastroBeats will strengthen its sustainability efforts by using
rechargeable batteries for selected lighting posts and back-of-house operations.
Solar energy will also be used to power air-conditioned “portaloos”, setting
a new benchmark for eco-conscious event amenities. To promote eco-conscious
habits, GastroBeats strongly encourages visitors to bring their own reusable
cups, flasks and tupperware to reduce waste. Eco-friendly food packaging
and utensils will be used, and no plastic straws will be provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't miss out on this ultimate fusion of food, music, and fun at GastroBeats
— from bites to beats, it’s a complete treat!</p>
