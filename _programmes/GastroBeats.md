<b>Get ready to eat, play, and dance the night away with <i>GastroBeats</i> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gastrobeats.com.sg">here</a>!</b><br><br>
	
<i>GastroBeats</i> is the Festival Village of i Light Singapore 2024 that will feature a wide range of gastronomic delights and musical experiences. Visitors will be spoilt for choice with the inclusion of more sustainably-produced food options, including items cultivated through organic farming methods, locally-grown seasonal produce and ethically sourced meat. An enticing array of local and international cuisine ranging from Mexican tacos, Russian dumplings and prawn noodles awaits.
<br><br>
	This year, <i>GastroBeats</i> will strengthen its sustainability efforts by tapping on solar energy to optimise rechargeable batteries for its light posts, wayfinding signages and powering back-of-house operations. Solar energy will also be used to power air-conditioned “portaloos”, setting a new benchmark for eco-conscious event amenities. To encourage visitors to put into practice green habits, <i>GastroBeats</i> strongly encourages visitors to bring their own cup/flask/tupperware to reduce waste. Eco-friendly food packaging and utensils will be used and no plastic straws will be provided.<br><br>
