<p><strong>The Conscious Festival x i Light Singapore - i Quest&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Change is at our fingertips.</p>
<p>Mangroves are the only trees that thrive in saltwater. Its dense root
system is a hiding place for small animals and a nursery habitat for young
marine species. Fostering incredible biodiversity, mangrove forests also
help prevent erosion and storm surges, and are formidable carbon sinks.
However, with urbanisation, expanding coastline development and industrial
pollution, these wetlands are facing an existential crisis.</p>
<p>The Conscious Festival x i Light Singapore introduces i Quest,&nbsp; which
uniquely merges art, advocacy and adventure to collectively inspire visitors
to safeguard the future of mangrove forests.</p>
<p>The Conscious Festival x i Light Singapore has partnered with Nature Society
Singapore to restore Sungei Pangsua Mangrove. The size of the clean-up
effort will be driven by visitorsâ€™ participation in i Quest.</p>
<p>While exploring the festival, help revitalise both virtual and real-life
mangrove forests by scanning the QR codes on display, and stand a chance
to unlock instant prizes - i Light Singapore vouchers that can be used
at The Conscious Festival x i Light Singapore Marketplace and GastroBeats
and win in the Grand Draw prize of $1000 cash sponsored by South Beach.</p>
