	<b>Take part in <i>i Light i Pledge, presented by Alibaba Cloud</i> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.susgain.com/iLightiPledge">here</a> and stand to win attractive prizes!</b>
<br><br>
This year, the Festival is once again partnering susGain, a local social enterprise championing sustainability, on <i>i Light i Pledge</i>. The public is encouraged to pledge their commitment to eco-conscious practices by making small but impactful changes in their daily lifestyle to cultivate sustainable habits.
<br><br>
They can do so through two separate pledges:
<br><br>
The <b><i>Switch Off, Turn Up (SOTU)</i></b> pledge calls for all to switch off non-essential lightings and turn up air-conditioning temperatures during and beyond the festival period. Since the Festival’s inception in 2010, SOTU has been a key component of i Light Singapore’s sustainability drive. The initiative has rallied many building owners, corporations and businesses around and beyond Marina Bay to reduce their energy consumption in lighting and air-conditioning. This year, more than 140 buildings and properties will be participating in the initiative (see list of participants <a target="_blank" href="/sustainability/switch-off-turn-up">here</a>). The programme has also been extended to the public and schools for the first time this year. 
<br><br>
The <b><i>Be a Zero Hero</i></b> pledge encourages the public to adopt zero waste habits such as reducing the use of single-use items and food waste. <br><br>
For each pledge submitted by participants up to the first 5,000 pledges, All Clear – a sustainability enterprise providing offshore and ocean clean-ups – will remove 100g of waste from Singapore waterways. As such, up to 500 kg of waste will be removed as an outcome of the pledge. The public can take part in <i>i Light i Pledge</i> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.susgain.com/iLightiPledge">here</a> and stand to win attractive prizes. 
<br><br>
For each pledge submitted online, a visual that is unique to each pledge, will be generated using Alibaba Cloud’s AI technologies. The visuals can be viewed on <i>i Light i Pledge’s</i> website and as part of the last chapter at <i>Lightwave: Turning the Tide</i>. This initiative aims to demonstrate how a small step taken by an individual can contribute to a larger sustainability objective.</p>
