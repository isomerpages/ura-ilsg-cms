Inspired by both the beauty and fragility of glaciers, <i>Glacier Dreams</i> is the result of a groundbreaking, long-term research project involving machine learning, environmental studies and multi-sensory media art.
<br><br>
Visual materials collated from publicly available data and institutional archives, together with glacier images personally collected by Refik Anadol in Iceland, are processed through machine learning algorithms and transformed into Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based multi-sensory narratives.
<br><br>
The artist, together with his Los Angeles-based team, hopes to raise awareness of climate change and rising sea levels through poetic glacier-themed experiences, and also contribute to the study of glaciers with their existing AI tools.

<b>About the Artist</b>
<br>
Born in Istanbul, Refik Anadol is a media artist, director and pioneer in the aesthetics of data and machine intelligence. His body of work locates creativity at the intersection of humans and machines.
<br><br>
Through radical visualisations of our digitised memories, Anadol expands the possibilities of architecture, narrative and the body in motion. This encourages us to rethink our engagement with the physical world and creative potential of machines.<br>
