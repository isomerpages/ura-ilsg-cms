<p><strong>Alchemy of Atmospheres</strong> 
<br>Janez Grošelj (Slovenia)
<br><strong>Location: </strong>Lawn beside NTUC Building&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Alchemy of Atmospheres</em> harnesses the mysteries in our atmospheric
conditions to craft a potent and auditory visual spectacle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arresting and disquieting, one is confronted with the often-overlooked
natural phenomenon of lightning — a rejuvenating and transformative force
hidden within a seemingly destructive impulse. The name of the installation
in itself suggests the metamorphosis of lightning, in which we play a significant
role in keeping its delicate balance. By heeding the silent warnings whispered
in the cracks of lightning, we can avoid the storms of a climate catastrophe.&nbsp;</p>
