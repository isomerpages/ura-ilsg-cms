<b>Aquatics</b><br>
Philipp Artus (Germany)<br>
<b>Location:</b> Under Esplanade Bridge (near Merlion Park)<br><br>

<i>Aquatics</i> is an interactive animation depicting sea creatures swimming around and interacting with one another. It explores the emergence of life through abstract shapes and movement.&nbsp;
<br><br>
Using a tablet, visitors can design their own creatures and add them to the underwater world.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><br>
By witnessing the beauty of animal locomotion in its natural habitat, participants are reminded of the urgent need to preserve biodiversity and ecosystems.
