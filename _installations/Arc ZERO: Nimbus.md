<p><strong>Arc ZERO: Nimbus</strong> 
<br>Studio James Tapscott (Australia)
<br><strong>Location: </strong>Pontoon near Red Dot Design Museum&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A ring of mist encircles the floating walkway that leads out into the
bay, and a window framing the city is created by the ever-evolving state
of the waters. As the mist diffuses around the oculus, it encourages reflection
on urbanisation and our use of finite resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through minimal intervention, <em>Arc ZERO: Nimbus</em> animates the mundane
and attempts to forge a new conversation with the elemental forces — water,
air, and light — that sustain us.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About the Artist</strong>
</p>
<p>Based in Australia, James Tapscott’s multidisciplinary practice combines
natural phenomena and light to create new experiences of the familiar with
a heightened awareness of nature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Site-responsive and experiential, Tapscott’s work encourages viewers to
embrace a state of coexistence with the natural environment. His use of
ephemeral materials, particularly water, mist and light, enables a creative
partnership between the artist and the site — the artwork often is not
fully realised until both collaborators have finished telling their stories.&nbsp;</p>
