Upon closer inspection, these are in fact made of a carefully weaved fabric of safety nets and scaffolding — everyday objects that the interior designers at DP Design encounter at construction sites. Here, the team transforms materials normally perceived as unsightly into a space that invites multiple interpretations of the mundane and its possibilities. <br><br>All plastics used to assemble <em>Blumiwave</em> will be recycled by local social enterprise Magorium after the festival. Supported by DBS Foundation, Magorium converts plastic waste into a sustainable construction material called ‘NEWBitumen’ that can replace crude-derived bitumen to pave roads sustainably.<br><br></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="DP Design" src="/images/Installations/2nd%20release/website.jpg"></div><p><strong>About the Artist</strong><br></p><p>Headquartered in Singapore, DP Design comprises a creative team of diverse talents, personalities and perspectives. Together, they have delivered and presented a preeminent international body of works since 1982.<br><br></p><p>Rooted in the belief that design has the capacity to uplift the human spirit, the interior design practice considers form, function and experience to create sustainable, memorable and meaningful places. In doing so, it synergises people, architecture and the ultimate purpose of the space. </p><table><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="4"><p>Presented by</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://www.dbs.com/livemore/index.html"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="DBS" src="/images/About/Sponsor%20Acknowledgement/dbs_resized%20web%20version.png"></a></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
