<p><strong>BottleBlooms</strong> 
<br>Yun (Singapore)
<br><strong>Location: </strong>Tanjong Pagar Park at Guoco Tower, Tras Link
Park near Orchid Hotel Singapore</p>
<p><em>BottleBlooms </em>is a display of solar-powered luminous plastic blossoms
in a green public space, crafted from approximately 1,000 upcycled polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) bottles through a public collection drive by Discover
Tanjong Pagar, Cantonment Primary School and City Sprouts, a social enterprise
with an aim to rejuvenate urban spaces.</p>
<p>The artwork provokes a re-evaluation of the things that are often thrown
away mindlessly and is a reminder of the transformative potential inherent
in our discarded materials. <em>BottleBlooms</em> urges us to think about
the life cycle of materials and encourages a more thorough incorporation
of plastics into the circular economy via PET recycling.</p>
