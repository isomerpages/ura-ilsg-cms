<p><strong>The Lantern</strong> 
<br>Josephine Pun Tsz Kiu (Hong Kong) | National University of Singapore (NUS)
<br><strong>Location: </strong>Courtyard between South Beach Tower and The
Grand Ballroom, Level 1</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nestled in the embrace of the city, the luminous pavilion emerges as a
contemplation on the voracious cycle of consumption. Its gentle luminescence
is an alluring invitation to be mesmerised by the sight of light dancing
upon the water within.</p>
<p>Made out of over 5,000 upcycled plastic water bottles — a staggering quantity
that mirrors the relentless pace of bottle disposal in Singapore recurring
every 7 minutes — <em>The Lantern</em> is a sobering physical embodiment
of our collective harm to the environment. Yet, by harnessing the beauty
of these upcycled materials, <em>The Lantern</em> is also a symbol of renewal
and a call for bolder, innovative design approaches to shape a more sustainable
future.</p>
