<p><strong>Modern Guru and the Path to Artificial Happiness</strong> 
<br>ENESS (Australia)
<br><strong>Location: </strong>Millenia Walk (The Great Hall)</p>
<p>Modern Guru and the Path to Artificial Happiness juxtaposes the timeless
archetype of a guru, traditionally a guide to attain spiritual enlightenment
and happiness, with the contemporary pursuit of fulfilment.</p>
<p>Inside the ceremonial shroud, visitors are greeted by the Modern Guru,
a translucent ovoid with four imposing large digital eyes suspended above
a spiralling ring of LEDs. A stream of absurdist messages flows from its
mouth.</p>
<p>A new message reveals when visitors point the lens of their camera to
capture a glimpse of the Modern Guru.</p>
<p>This installation is a commentary on the role that technology plays in
shaping perceptions of fulfilment in the digital age.</p>
