<p><strong>BOB the nice world</strong> 
<br>BOB the nice guy (Thailand)
<br><strong>Location: </strong>Next to the entrance of Marina Bay Link Mall&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>BOB the nice world</em> is a lightweight inflatable sculpture depicting
a whimsical line-drawn character named <em>BOB the nice guy</em> who tells
his story through playful moving images.<em> BOB</em>â€™s conspicuous presence
at Marina Bay is intentionally disruptive. While he glows with positivity,
behind his irresistibly cute charm lies a subtle but pressing sense of
urgency as he calls for mindful action against the gloom of climate change.&nbsp;</p>
