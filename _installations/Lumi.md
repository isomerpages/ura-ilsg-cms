<p><strong>Lumi</strong> 
<br>Ye Sul E. Cho, Sara Ibrahim, Suz Ibrahim, Heather Noble
<br>65 SQM @ SUSA SPACE (United Kingdom)
<br><strong>Location: </strong>Fountain Plaza, South Beach Avenue Level 1</p>
<p>Paying homage to Singapore’s maritime heritage, Lumi embodies the fluidity
of meandering river paths and its state of perpetual flux.</p>
<p>This interactive installation invites play, connection and reflection
within the bustling urban landscape. Tactile and immersive, it implores
visitors to engage with one another and in the process, mould and remould
the artwork in a shared act of co-creation. The repurposing of ordinary
objects, such as yoga balls, demonstrates the transformative potential
inherent in the mundane. Join in — to play, or to rest.</p>
