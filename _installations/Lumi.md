<p><strong>Lumi</strong> 
<br>Heather Noble, Sara Ibrahim, Suz Ibrahim, Ye Sul E. Cho | 65 SQM @ SUSA
SPACE (United Kingdom)
<br><strong>Location: </strong>Fountain Plaza, South Beach Avenue Level 1</p>
<p>Paying homage to Singapore’s maritime heritage, <em>Lumi </em>embodies
the fluidity of meandering river paths and its state of perpetual flux.</p>
<p>This interactive installation invites play, connection and reflection
within the bustling urban landscape. Tactile and immersive, it implores
visitors to engage one another, as their collective interactions mould
and remould the artwork in a shared act of co-creation. The repurposing
of ordinary objects, such as yoga balls, demonstrates the transformative
potential inherent in the mundane. Join in — to play, or to rest.</p>

<p><strong>About the Artist</strong>
</p>
<p>65 SQM is the installations subsidiary of SUSA SPACE, a women-led collective
focused on architecture, design and research. The studio places sustainability
at its core, emphasising the reuse of materials. Driven by the principle
of 'design by making’, the practice seeks to free material from its form
and form from its tradition. By allowing design to participate and form
agency through questioning design methodologies and engaging in fabrication
early on, 65 SQM’s goal is to reconstitute parts of traditional construction
and cultural research to shape new and innovative spaces.</p>
