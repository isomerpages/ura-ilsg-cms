<p><strong>Iwagumi Air Scape</strong> 
<br>ENESS (Australia)
<br><strong>Location: </strong>The Promontory at Marina Bay&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Iwagumi Air Scape </em>is inspired by the Japanese art form of Iwagumi,
the arrangement of rocks in aquascaping, or underwater gardening, that
places a heavy emphasis on the raw, humble beauty of nature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conjuring an illusion of immense weight, the air-filled inflatables carry
the allure and mystery of mountains within them. Colours and soundscapes
evolve based on the movement of city dwellers passing through. Encountering
these quiet but majestic boulders which are typically found in untamed
landscapes brings a sense of awe and wonderment of existence into the urban
experience.&nbsp;</p>
