<p><strong>Kinetic Perspective</strong> 
<br>Juan Fuentes Studio (Spain)
<br><strong>Location: </strong>Marina Bay Sands Event Plaza</p>
<p><em>Kinetic Perspective</em> is an immersive abstract geometric experience
inspired by the Optical Art Movement of the 1960s that uses optical illusions.</p>
<p>The circles within the installation are in perpetual motion, spinning
ceaselessly. This rhythmic movement is echoed and repeated as each circle
completes a full rotation. The synchronised spinning generates mesmerising
visual patterns that persistently recur. By moving around the installation,
visitors can discover infinite combinations of patterns and distortion.
The artworkâ€™s hypnotising fluidity invites contemplation on the eternal
rhythms embedded within our existence.</p>
