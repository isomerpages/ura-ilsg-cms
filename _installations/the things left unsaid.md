Repeatedly confronted by news of a gloomy future and an impending climate catastrophe, the artwork acts as a refuge from despair.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Comprising weaved sheets made of upcycled plastic bags draped across the space, the artwork exudes a sense of both comfort and unease, much like the mysterious phenomenon of bioluminescent algal bloom that inspired it. Above all, it is a quiet reminder of the hope and possibilities that still exist. <br><br></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="Brigette Teo" src="/images/Installations/2nd%20release/brigette_profile_portrait_ilsg23%20-%20brigette%20teo.jpg"></div><p><strong>About the Artist</strong><br>Brigette Teo is an interactive media artist currently pursuing a degree at Nanyang Technological University, School of Art, Design and Media. <br><br>With a passion for fibre handiwork such as crochet and sewing, she enjoys exploring opportunities to create accessible and interactive tactile works.
