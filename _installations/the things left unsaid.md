<b>Location:</b> Breeze Shelter
<br><br>
<i>the things left unsaid</i> is a manifestation of the artist’s unspoken thoughts and feelings about growing up in a time of seemingly never-ending doom. Repeatedly confronted by news of a gloomy future and an impending climate catastrophe, the artwork acts as a refuge from despair.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><br>
Visitors can wander among wave sheets made of upcycled plastic bags draped across the space, and gently touch them to see the lights react and change. The artwork exudes a sense of both comfort and unease, much like the mysterious phenomenon of bioluminescent algal bloom that inspired it. Above all, it is a quiet reminder of the hope and possibilities that still exist.
