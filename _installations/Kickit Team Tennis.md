<p><strong>Kickit Team Tennis</strong> 
<br>Limelight (Hungary)
<br><strong>Location: </strong>Discover Tanjong Pagar Community Green</p>
<p><em>Kickit Team Tennis </em>is an interactive light art game that can
be played by two teams of up to five a side.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A visit to the Barbican, a gothic gate-tower in Pécs, Hungary inspired
the creation of this modern tennis game. By reimagining a traditionally
solo sport for teamplay in a public space, this installation encourages
visitors to interact and collaborate with strangers — a call to find common
ground and unity through friendly competition and play.</p>
