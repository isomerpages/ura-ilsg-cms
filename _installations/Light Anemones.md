It seeks to portray the captivating world beyond the water surface, where the mysteries of the deep sea and the wonders of underwater creatures come to life. <br><br>During the day, the sculpture’s surroundings and sunlight are reflected on the curved titanium-stainless steel mirrors. In the night, linear beams appear due to the play of light along the sculpture’s concave and convex structure with a rotating centre. As light from the three sculptures interact with one another and merge with mirrored silhouettes of neighbouring buildings, people and landscape, a complex symphony of light, sound and imagery is composed — as though from a different time continuum.<br><br></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="Malte Kebbel" src="/images/Installations/2nd%20release/malte_kebbel_profile_landscape_ilsg23%20-%20malte%20kebbel.jpg"></div><p><strong>About the Artist</strong><br>Malte Kebbel is a German artist who creates large-scale light and sculpture installations for public spaces.&nbsp; <br><br>Kebbel's current work focuses on questioning our evolving relationship with urban space, light, nature and energy. He uses lighting technologies, synthetic materials, parametric design and 3D technology to create monumental structures with geometric shapes and patterns reminiscent of nature.&nbsp;His installations are like temporary temples, shrines and places of contemplation that give new meanings to urban space and create new connections.</p><p></p>
