<p><strong>Pure Ring</strong> 
<br>Xu Dongliang
<br><strong>Location: </strong>Event Square&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A modern twist to the concept of musical chairs, <em>Pure Ring</em> aspires
to foster unexpected connections among strangers, sparking moments of serendipity
amidst the urban bustle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When&nbsp; unoccupied, this interactive installation orchestrates a mesmerising
interplay of light and sound. Once a module is sat on, the installation
reacts with a colour change, initiating a mysterious pairing with another
module chosen at random unbeknownst to its audience. The synchronised modules
will simultaneously turn red for the chosen pair seated atop them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This artwork hopes to foster connections through the convergence of light.&nbsp;</p>
