With our movements restricted to indoor spaces, the world turned quiet and seemed motionless. Time stood still.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><em>Moooooootion</em> is an interactive stage set conceived as a playful counterpoint to the confinement brought about by lockdowns. At this installation, visitors are encouraged to bring colour and music to a grey world through movement.<br><br></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="XD49" src="/images/Installations/2nd%20release/xd49_profile_landscape_ilsg23%20-%20tanskul%20suwannakudt(1).png"></div><p><strong>About the Artist</strong><br>Founded in 2021, XD49 (Experience Design 49) is a new media and multi-disciplinary design studio.&nbsp; <br><br>Using audio-visual and interactive technologies, the studio assimilates digital and physical spaces creatively to produce unconventional, poignant and memorable experiences that blur the lines between imagination and reality.</p><p><br></p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="4"><p>Presented by</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/About/Sponsor%20Acknowledgement/202301_ilight%20singapore%20(gastrobeats%20logo).png"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>In collaboration with<br>Awakening Bangkok from Bangkok, Thailand</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
