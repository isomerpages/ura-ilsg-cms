<p><strong>Fish are Jumping</strong> 
<br>Studio Toer (The Netherlands)
<br><strong>Location: </strong>Waterbody near Marina Bay lower boardwalk steps&nbsp;</p>
<p>A tribute to the delightful surprises found in everyday moments, <em>Fish are Jumping </em>draws
attention to the simple wonders of nature. Inspired by the leaping of fish
above the water's surface, the installation is a tapestry of light and
shadow, movement and stillness, and sound and silence. Observe, and be
enchanted.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About the Artists</strong>
</p>
<p>Studio Toer is a multidisciplinary design studio from the Netherlands,
founded by Castor Bours and Wouter Widdershoven in 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the freedom of play as their starting point, works by Studio Toer
are experimental and filled with curiosity. Pushing both the technical
and aesthetic limits of design across a wide range of applied arts — from
light installations and objects to interactive experiences and innovative
products — Studio Toer's creations have been featured in countless international
festivals including Vivid Sydney, Fête des Lumières Lyon and Glow Eindhoven.&nbsp;</p>
