<br>
Amigo &amp; Amigo (Australia)&nbsp;
<br>
	<b>Location</b>: Clifford Square&nbsp;
<br><br>
Step into a giant musical garden and be surrounded by an immersive jungle of light, colour and sound. At <i>Trumpet Flowers</i>, visitors get the opportunity to create a unique floral symphony using interactive keys that control the towering musical and light instruments.&nbsp;
<br><br>
Inspired by gramophones, these super-sized flowers burst to life occasionally with a specially commissioned musical score by Otis Studio, accompanied by some of Sydney’s finest jazz musicians.
