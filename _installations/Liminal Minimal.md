<br>Blue energy is harnessed from the chemical potential of a salinity difference
between the sea and river waters. <em>Blumiwave</em> is an interpretation
of this renewable energy source.
<br>
<br>Seen from afar, sculptural waves appear to crash at varying heights and
directions. Upon closer inspection, these are in fact made of a carefully
weaved fabric of safety nets and scaffolding — everyday objects that the
interior designers at DP Design encounter at construction sites. Here,
the team transforms materials normally perceived as unsightly into a space
that invites multiple interpretations of the mundane and its possibilities.
<br>
<br>All plastics used to assemble <em>Blumiwave</em> will be recycled by local
social enterprise Magorium after the festival. Supported by DBS Foundation,
Magorium converts plastic waste into a sustainable construction material
called ‘NEWBitumen’ that can replace crude-derived bitumen to pave roads
sustainably.
