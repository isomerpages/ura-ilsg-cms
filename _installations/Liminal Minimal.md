<p>Waste lurks unseen in the built environment — a silent witness to the
development of a modern city and its excesses. Assembled with wooden beams,
reclaimed pallets and discarded dust nettings, <em>Liminal; Minimal</em> exposes
the hidden wastefulness of urban construction by framing the surrounding
cityscape with remnants from building sites.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the relentless pursuit of urban densification, Singapore finds itself
at a crossroads. <em>Liminal; Minimal</em> is an interrogation of our intricate
entanglement with waste, a forced confrontation with the transient nature
of our built environment and an insistent call for sustainable practices
in the face of rapid urban development.</p>
